\chapter{Initial Investigation of Parameters}
In this chapter, show and talk about how different parameters affected the training performance \\
All tests in this chapter were performed on MNIST with this model: MODEL. All agents had direct communication to all other agents. Unless otherwise stated, all agents were run on a single 3060 GPU communicating over localhost\\
The syncing was also done with the basic implementation from the previous chapter
\section{Overhead Testing}
Report on overheads caused by the swarm
\section{Data Volume per Node}
Compare how different data volumes affect performance
\section{Epochs of Training Between Syncs}
\section{Number of Nodes in Network}
\section{Sync Weight}
