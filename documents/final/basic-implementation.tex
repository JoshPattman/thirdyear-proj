\chapter{Vanilla Implementation}
The implementation for this project is split into two modules: Sync algorithm and Networking. The Sync Algo takes a 1D array of parameters and uses the Networking module to send the parameters to other nodes. The sync algo also requests parameters from other nodes using the network module. This is done to allow the system to be easy to understand, as each module has a clear purpose. This also allows networking to be easily switched out later to a possibly faster implementation. It also means the the actual node code that does trianing need not know about any comple network situations, but it just needs to call some easy to use functions to perform syncs.
