\section{Comparison of SL to FL}
\todo{Write something useful here}

\subsection{Comparing \SL to FedAvg}
\todo{Write this out}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Can prevent a single slow node from bottlenecking the whole process
	\item No central server so more fault tolerant
	\item Can still function if all nodes do not have direct connections to all other nodes (in the case of FL every node must have access to the server)
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Less data transmission ($O(n)$ rather than worst case $O(n^2)$). This effect is less prominent if SL is sparse
	\item FL is a Less complex algorithm -> fewer parameters to tune -> easier to fit to a problem
	\item Slower to converge
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparing \SL to \emph{Swarm Learning}}

\subsection{Limitations of the \SL}
can diverge, unlike using blockchain

needs an extra layer of security, but this is built into blockchain

\subsection{Further Uses of \SL}
could be used for any situation where a group of agents need to come to a consensus of a moving targeted thing, where each agent updates the target slightly
