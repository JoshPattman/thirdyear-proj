\section{Why would you choose SL over FL}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can prevent a single slow node from bottlenecking the whole process
	\item No central server so more fault tolerant
	\item Can still function if all nodes do not have direct connections to all other nodes (in the case of FL every node must have access to the server)
\end{itemize}
\section{Why would you choose FL over SL}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Less data transmission ($O(n)$ rather than worst case $O(n^2)$). This effect is less prominent if SL is sparse
	\item Less complex algorithm -> fewer parameters to tune
\end{itemize}
