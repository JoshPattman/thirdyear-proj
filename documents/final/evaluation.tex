\section{Comparison of SL to FL}
\todo{Make this sentence into a paragraph with some more detail?}

This report has show that SL has the capability to be a competitor to FL in a distributed learning situation. SL can also be used in some situations where FL cannot. However, there are some clear disadvantages to using SL as opposed to FL.

\subsection{Advantages of using SL over FL}
\todo{Write this out}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Can prevent a single slow node from bottlenecking the whole process
	\item No central server so more fault tolerant
	\item Can still function if all nodes do not have direct connections to all other nodes (in the case of FL every node must have access to the server)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Disadvantages of using SL over FL}
\todo{Write this out}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Less data transmission ($O(n)$ rather than worst case $O(n^2)$). This effect is less prominent if SL is sparse
	\item FL is a Less complex algorithm -> fewer parameters to tune -> easier to fit to a problem
	\item Slower to converge
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Limitations of the Presented Implementation}
can diverge, unlike using blockchain

needs an extra layer of security, but this is built into blockchain

\subsection{Further Extensions of Presented Implementation}
could be used for any situation where a group of agents need to come to a consensus of a moving targeted thing, where each agent updates the target slightly
