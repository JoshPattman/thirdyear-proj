\section{Comparison of SL to Other Methods}
\todo{Write something useful here}

\subsection{Comparing \SL to FedAvg}
\todo{Write this out}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Can prevent a single slow node from bottlenecking the whole process
	\item No central server so more fault tolerant to node dropouts
	\item Can still function if all nodes do not have direct connections to all other nodes (in the case of FL every node must have access to the server)
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Less data transmission ($O(n)$ rather than worst case $O(n^2)$). This effect is less prominent if SL is sparse
	\item FL is a Less complex algorithm -> fewer parameters to tune -> easier to fit to a problem
	\item Slower to converge
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparing \SL to \emph{Swarm Learning}}
\todo{cant really compare results but can compare use of blockchain theoretically}

\SL can diverge, unlike using blockchain

\SL needs an extra layer of security, but this is built into blockchain

\section{Pitfalls of this Study}

\todo{Give these titles proper names}

\todo{Write these sections}

\subsection{Did not test overhead (time measurements)}

\subsection{Did not test internet enabled stuff which causes lag in model updates}
