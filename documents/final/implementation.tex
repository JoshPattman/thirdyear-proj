\section{Initial Experimentation and Setup}
Before development of the swarm learning algorithm began, some initial experiments were performed to assist with implementation in further stages.
\subsection{Model}
\subsection{Problem Difficulty}
mnist -> mnist fashion \\
less data
\subsection{Data Distribution}
rest
\subsection{Federated Learning}
Implementing federated learning


\section{Prototype}
Algorithm expain:
why no blockcahin
flow of data + diagram
learning rate
chosen metrics:
accuracy over time (sparse categorical crossentropy)
results
reflection and downfalls

\section{Final}
Algorithm explain + changes from last:
on demand model -> model when trained + local cache
flow of data diagram
training counter
learning rate vs no learning rate

switch to local backend
accuracy over epochs
results (will be discussed in more detail later on)
