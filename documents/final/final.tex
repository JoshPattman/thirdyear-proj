	Federated learning is a technique that allows a machine learning model to be trained on data distributed across multiple data islands. This approach protects privacy by keeping the data decentralized, meaning that sensitive data does not need to ever be shared. Swarm learning is a similar technique that eliminates the need for a central server, ensuring that not only the data, but also the communication, is completely decentralized. In this paper, a novel swarm learning technique called SwarmAvg is presented which operates without a blockchain. The algorithm is validated against federated learning in various scenarios, and also in some situations where federated learning cannot be applied.
