		\frametitle{The Problems}
		\textbf{Privacy}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Data stored in multiple locations
			\item Cannot share the data between locations for privacy reasons
			\item \emph{Medical records}
		\end{itemize}
		
		\textbf{Performance}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Machine learning needs lots of processing power
			\item A supercomputer is not available to many
			\item However they may have access to many lower power devices (nodes)
			\item \emph{Company with many unused computers during the night}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Federated Learning - The Current Solution}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A single model is stored on the server
			\item Each node has its own dataset
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This is not shared with other nodes or the server
			\end{itemize}
			\item The model can be shared between the server and clients
			\item \textbf{Goal:} Perform machine learning without sharing the model
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Federated Learning - How Does It Work?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Many variations of federated learning
			\begin{itemize}
				\item One of the originals is \emph{Federated Averaging (FedAvg)}
				\item Many other algorithms are based off this
			\end{itemize}
			\item FedAvg has repeated Training Steps. Each Step:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Server sends model to a set of nodes
				\item Nodes perform training on the model
				\item Nodes send their models back to server
				\item New model is the average (mean) of all nodes models
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Federated Learning - Issues}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Vulnerable to central server going down
			\item Requires that every node has direct access to the server
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}


	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{What is Swarm Learning?}
		Swarm Learning
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Each node has a model
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Every model approximates the \emph{global model}
			\end{itemize}
			\item Each node has it's own dataset
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This dataset cannot be shared with any other nodes
			\end{itemize}
			\item The goal is to train the \emph{global model} using all available data
			\item Additionally, there should be no central server or node acting as a central server 
		\end{itemize}
