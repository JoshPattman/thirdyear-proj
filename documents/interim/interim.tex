	\chapter*{Abstract}	
	Federated learning is a technique that allows a machine learning model to be trained on data distributed across multiple data islands without ever sharing the data. This approach protects privacy by keeping the data decentralized. Swarm learning is a similar technique that eliminates the need for a central server, ensuring that not only the data, but also the communication, is completely decentralized. The present paper conducts experiments with swarm learning and discusses the results. The experiments focus on adapting swarm learning for real-life situations and addressing issues that arise when applying swarm learning to certain use-cases. Furthermore, this paper examines methods for improving the performance of swarm learning when compared to standard centralized learning, demonstrating that it is a promising technique not only for protecting privacy, but also for making better use of available computing power.
