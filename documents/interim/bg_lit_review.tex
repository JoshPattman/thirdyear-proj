\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{A survey on federated learning \cite{survey_on_fed_learning}}
This paper is a good introductory piece to the field of federated learning. It covers a wide range of topics, without going into too much detail, which was useful to direct the author into reading more specific papers. The paper also has a basic introduction to how federated learning works, and also some potential use cases for federated learning. All in all, this paper helped point the author in the right direction for further research.

\subsection{Swarm Learning for decentralized and confidential clinical machine learning \cite{swarm_learning}}
Despite the fact that this paper focusses on a medical use case, it is a good introductory piece to the topic of swarm learning. A theme of the paper is privacy, and how it can affect the training speed of models. The paper points out that due to privacy legislation, sharing data between hospitals is not possibly, which can mean that training machine learning models does not reach an optimal outcome. However, a solution is proposed in the form of swarm learning: effectively a decentralised form of federated learning. It is shown that swarm learning can outperform the models trained at individual hospitals without communication.

The paper also gives a good high level summary of how the swarm learning algorithm works. This was particularly useful in giving the author a basic understanding of swarm learning to prepare for further research.

\subsection {Federated learning in Robotic and Autonomous Systems \cite{fed_in_robotics}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduced to using federated learning in robotics
	\item Real world reasons that federated learning is useful in the field of robotics
	\item Horizontal/vertical federated learning
	\item Brief look at federated object detection
	\item Practical challenges of federated (model upload time, etc)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Decentralized Federated Learning: A Segmented Gossip Approach \cite{gossip_learning}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Problem of bandwidth for federated learning
	\item Had a very cool novel idea that every step each node only needs to pull a segment of the network. This reduces bandwidth and should deffo be somthing to try
\end{itemize}
